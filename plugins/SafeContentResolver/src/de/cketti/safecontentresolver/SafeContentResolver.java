/**
 * A replacement for {@code ContentResolver} that protects against the <em>Surreptitious Sharing</em> attack when
 * opening {@code file://} URIs.
 *
 * <p>
 * When performing a Surreptitious Sharing attack a malicious app tries to trick the user into sending a file private
 * to the target app to an attacker.
 * </p><p>
 * Example:<br>
 * An {@link Intent#ACTION_SEND} intent that contains the attacker's email address as recipient and a {@code file://}
 * URI pointing to the file the email client uses to store account passwords. The attacking app itself doesn't have
 * access to this file because Android's security model prevents that. However, the email client has no trouble
 * opening a file that belongs to itself. If the user believes this to be a legitimate email with a legitimate
 * attachment, e.g. because the malicious app asked them to send a bug report, they will send the email and thereby
 * unknowingly expose their email account passwords to the attacker.
 * </p><p>
 * If your app is a receiver of such {@code Intents} and you want to protect against this attack, replace all
 * occurrences of {@link ContentResolver#openInputStream(Uri)} with {@link SafeContentResolver#openInputStream(Uri)}
 * from this class. {@code SafeContentResolver} will refuse to open {@code file://} URIs pointing to files belonging to
 * this app.
 * </p><p>
 * On older Android versions apps have the ability to create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link">hard
 * links</a> to files they don't have read or write access to. That means we can't simply check the absolute file path
 * to learn if a file is stored in our own app-private directory. Instead, we use the {@code fstat} system call to
 * retrieve the User ID the file belongs to. And if it's identical to the UID of this process, access is denied.
 * </p>
